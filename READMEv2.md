Hello there!

Welcome to SmellsPhishy, a Chrome extension that helps keep you safe from untrustworthy websites and potential phishing scams. Unlike most phishing protection extensions which only alert you of a dangerous website once you are on the site, SmellsPhishy checks BEFORE you click on a potentially dangerous link. All information stays local and we do not store any of your browsing data. 

In essence, the way that SmellsPhishy works is by comparing the links (hrefs) the website you are currently visiting contains and comparing these links to a database of the most frequented sites in the world that are considered safe. After finishing the comparison, SmellsPhishy will display a percentage that will give you a general overview of how safe the links on the site are, so we recommend that you exercise caution when navigating websites with less than a 30% rating. 
Furthermore, if you click the SmellsPhishy icon you will see the option to highlight bad links which puts a red border around the links it deems as potentially unsafe, so as to alert you without being overly intruding.  

To load up SmellsPhishy, navigate to chrome://extensions/ which you can also find through the options menu -> More Tools -> Extensions. Ensure that you have Developer mode turned on in the top right and then press Load unpacked and load up SmellsPhishy's unzipped folder and you should be good to go!
After you load SmellsPhishy into Chrome, it will start working in the background automatically to keep you safe!

No necessary steps are required to test or use SmellsPhishy, just continue your browsing activity normally and SmellsPhishy will run in the background. However, if you want to test a potentially unsafe site navigate to www.movie4k.is which is a risky site that does not seem particularly trustworthy and is not on our database.

If you want to test a website that is intermediately safe one way is to just google some strange and potentially phishing-leading term like 'free iphones' and see the results that Google turns up: https://www.google.com/search?q=free+iphone&oq=free+iph&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i60j69i59j69i57j0j69i60.9812j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
You will see an intermediate rating as some of the links read to legitimate sites (such as offers from Sprint, AT&T, or Apple) while others lead to potential scams and viruses.

If you want to test a website that is completely safe, navigate to any major website like google.com, wikipedia.org, usa.gov, etc.

To see the extra features of the extension, click on its icon in the top right toolbar. Sometimes this make take a few seconds to load depending on the speed of your computer and the number of links the extension has to analyze on the page. Once you click on the icon, you will see 2 buttons. Clicking on 'Send a report to developers' opens a Google Form through which you can submit any concerns, bugs, questions, or suggestions you have about the extention to the developers. 
If you click 'Highlight bad links', the extension will highlight any potentially risky links on the page by outlining them with a thick red border. 

If you ever have any concers with a particular link that was or wasn't highlighted, you can report it thorugh the 'Send a report to developers' button. For example, you can report any 'false positives' (absolutely safe sites that are highlighted) or report any unhighlighted links that are actually dangerous and should be highlighted.
